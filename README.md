# pyElectrochem
Some programs to simulate common experiments in electrochemistry : chronoamperometry, voltammetry and maybe more in a near future. Implemented in Python, with numpy, scipy and matplotlib under the hood.

## Voltammetry with a Nernstian boundary condition

Use [voltammetry.py](voltammetry-nernst/voltammetry.py), some help is given with "./voltammetry.py -h" about all the arguments and default values used. You can save a movie, a csv file, a numpy version for further use.

## Voltammetry for a quasi reversible boundary condition

Use "[voltammetry-quasi-reversible.py](voltammetry-quasi-reversible/voltammetry-quasi-reversible.py)" some help is given with "voltammetry-quasi-reversible.py -h" about all the arguments and default values used. 

## Chronoamperometry

Use "[chronoamperometry.py](chronoamperometry/chronoamperometry.py)". The boundary condition imposed is to set the conventration to zero at the electrode.

## Butler Volmer

Use "[Butler-Volmer.py](Butler-Volmer/Butler-Volmer.py)". Requires "[Butler-Volmer/widgets.py](widgets.py)". Prefer the use of "python3 Butler-Volmer.py" over "./Butler-Volmer.py" to exectute the script
